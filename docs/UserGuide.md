# GuestNote User Guide
**Welcome to GuestNote!**  
> Time is money, and in the hotel industry, every second counts.

Mistakes in guest handling - like assigning the wrong room or forgetting a special request - don’t just hurt your workflow. They hurt your guests’ experience and cost your hotel real money.  

**That’s where GuestNote comes in.**

Adapted from [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](#glossary), **GuestNote** takes the core of a reliable contact management system and reimagines it for hotel operations. The result? A lightning-fast desktop app built for concierges and front desk staff, designed for the speed of a [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary), but with the clarity of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#glossary), when managing hotel guests. Think of it as muscle memory meets modern [User Interface (UI)](#glossary) – if you can type, you can fly.

### Listing all guests : `list`
--- 
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Shows a list of all guests in the guest list.
* The list is sorted by the order in which guests were added.
* An optional filter can be applied to **show only guests with requests**.
* An optional filter can be applied to **show only guests whose names match the filter**.
  * The search is case-insensitive (e.g. `john` matches `John`).
  * Partial matches allowed. For example, `Alex` matches `Alexis`, `Alexandar`.
* The filters are provided for convenience to quickly find guests in the guest list, a stronger search can be done using the [find](#locating-guests-find) command.

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-i-cursor:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Format: `list [rq\] [NAME_FILTER]…`
- **`list`** displays every guest.
- **`list rq\`** displays only guests with requests (i.e. guests whose request field is not null).
- **`list NAME_FILTER…`** displays only guests whose names match the filter.
- **`list rq\ NAME_FILTER…`** displays only guests with requests whose names match the filter.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `list`!!<br>
Shows a list of all guests in the guest list.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `list rq\`!!<br>
Shows a list of all guests in the guest list with requests.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `list John`!!<br>
Shows a list of all guests with `John` in their name, including `John Doe` and `Johnathon Chua`.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `list rq\ John Alex`!!<br>
Shows a list of all guests with requests, with either `John` or `Alex` in their name, including `John Doe` and `Alexander Chua`.
</box>
</div>
<br>

### Locating guests: `find`
--- 
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

The `find` command now searches across all guest fields by default—including name, email, phone number, room number, and requests. Use this command to search for a keyword that may appear in any field.
* At least one keyword must be provided. 
* Like the [list](#listing-all-guests-list) command's name filter, the search is case-insensitive and partial matches are allowed.
* The search is performed across all guest fields (name, phone number, room number, and requests).
* Guests matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. an OR search).

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-triangle-exclamation:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Warning:**
- Avoid using overly generic or very short keywords, as these may produce unintended matches.
- Because the command uses an OR search across all fields, multiple keywords can broaden your search results more than expected.
</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-i-cursor:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…`
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `find John`!!<br>
Shows a list where any field (e.g. email, name) contains the full word "John" (e.g. "John Doe").
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `find BOOKED`!!<br>
Shows all guests with the status `BOOKED`. You can also apply this for other statuses like `CHECKED IN` or `CHECKED OUT`, however you will need to use `find CHECKED_IN` and `find CHECKED_OUT` instead. 
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `find 03-04`!!<br>
Shows all guests where any field (e.g. email, name) contains the full word "03-04" (e.g. "03-04"). This is useful for looking up the guests in a specific room. Note that the `#` symbol is not required.
</box>

</div>
<br>


### Editing a guest: `edit`
--- 
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Edits an existing guest in the guest list.
* Edits the guest at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed guest list. The index **must be a positive integer and must be valid** (ie. within the number of guests displayed).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If the edit results in a duplicate guest in the guest list (ie. two with the same email address), the command is not allowed.

</box>
<box theme="secondary" icon=":fa-solid-info:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px; color:#999999" seamless>

Other flags to edit a guest by [Adding a Request](#adding-a-request-to-a-guest-edit-index-rq-request) and [Removing a Request](#removing-a-request-of-a-guest-edit-index-rq-request) can be used together in this command, but they have been omitted here for clarity. They are covered in later sections.

<br>

### Adding a request to a guest: `edit INDEX [+rq\REQUEST]…`
--- 
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="secondary" icon=":fa-solid-info:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px; color:#999999" seamless>

_Conditions and features described in the previous section on [edit](#editing-a-guest-edit) command apply. <br> You may still use flags such as `n\NAME`, `p\PHONE`, `e\EMAIL`, and `r\ROOMNUMBER` to edit the guest's details, but they have been omitted here for brevity._
</box>
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Adds** a request to an existing guest in the guest list.
* Request names should be alphanumeric, may include spaces, and must not exceed 75 characters
* **Requests must be unique to the guest.** 
  * Requests spelled the same will be considered the same, regardless of capitalisation.

* The new request will be **added** to the back of the current request list for the guest.

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-i-cursor:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Format: `edit INDEX [+rq\REQUEST]…​`

<box theme="secondary" icon=":fa-solid-info:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px; color:#999999" seamless>

_Conditions and features described in the previous section on [edit](#editing-a-guest-edit) command apply. <br> You may still use flags such as `n\NAME`, `p\PHONE`, `e\EMAIL`, and `r\ROOMNUMBER` to edit the guest's details, but they have been omitted here for brevity._
</box>
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Removes** an existing request of an existing guest in the guest list.
* The request will be **removed** from the list of requests for the guest.
  * The request to be removed must be spelled the same as the request in the list of requests for the guest.
  * You !!do not!! need to match the same capitalisation as the request in the list of requests for the guest.
* If the request is not found in the list of requests for the guest, nothing will happen and an error message will be shown.

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-i-cursor:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

Format: `edit INDEX [-rq\REQUEST]…​`
</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-triangle-exclamation:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

* `-ri\REQUEST_INDEX` and `-rq\REQUEST` cannot be used together in the same edit command.
* Using together with `+rq\REQUEST` allows you to replace requests.
* To prevent confusion, index removed will always be **based on the current request list**.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `edit 2 -rq\Extra blanket`!!<br>
Edits guest No.2 in the list by removing the request `Extra blanket` (or any variant capitalisation of it, including `EXTRA BLANKET`, `Extra Blanket`, and `extra blanket`).
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `edit 2 -rq\Extra blanket -rq\Extra pillow`!!<br>
Edits guest No.2 in the list by removing two requests `Extra blanket` and `Extra pillow`.
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `edit 2 -rq\extra pillow +rq\Extra Pillow`!!<br>
Edits guest No.2 in the list by removing the request spelled `extra pillow` and adding `Extra Pillow`. This is okay as the lowercase version is removed before `Extra Pillow` is added, so no duplicate requests are created.
</box>
<box theme="danger" icon=":fa-solid-xmark:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

!!Sample Input: `edit 2 -ri\1 -rq\Extra Towel`!!<br>
**Tries to use `-ri\` and `-rq\` together.** The above command is not allowed as the requests deleted can be different depending on how the command is interpreted.
**To prevent confusion, nothing will occur, and an error message will be shown.**
</box>
</div>
<br>

### Removing a request by index: `edit INDEX [-ri\REQUEST_INDEX]`

### Notes on the data file
---
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="success" icon=":fa-solid-check:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>
Any changes to the data are immediately saved to the data file. **There is no need to save manually.**
</box>
<box theme="primary" icon=":fa-solid-question:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

The data file is stored in the home folder of GuestNote, where you placed the GuestNote jar file.
- The data file is named `guestnote.json` and is created automatically when you run the application for the first time.
- The data file is used to store all the guest information in JSON format, which is a standard format for storing data in a structured way.

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":fa-solid-triangle-exclamation:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Caution:** Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file, however, please note:
- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GuestNote will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, **it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it**.<br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause the GuestNote to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, **edit the data file only if you are confident** that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous GuestNote home folder.

**Q**: What should I do if the app crashes or behaves unexpectedly?<br>
**A**: Ensure you are using the correct version of Java as specified in the Quick Start section. If the issue persists, check the log files for any error messages and report them to the [support team](/AboutUs.html)

**Q**: Can I use GuestNote on multiple computers simultaneously?<br>
**A**: GuestNote is designed to be used on a single computer. Using it on multiple computers simultaneously may lead to data inconsistencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
3. **Slow performance on large guest lists**, if the guest list contains a large number of entries, the application may experience slow performance. The remedy is to periodically clear out old or unnecessary entries.
