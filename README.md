# GuestNote

## **Overview**
___
**Welcome to GuestNote!**  
_Time is money, and in the hotel industry, every second counts._

Mistakes in guest handling - like assigning the wrong room or forgetting a special request - don’t just hurt your workflow. They hurt your guests’ experience and cost your hotel real money.

**That’s where GuestNote comes in.**

Adapted from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3), **GuestNote** takes the core of a reliable contact management system and reimagines it for hotel operations. The result? A lightning-fast desktop app built for concierges and front desk staff, designed for the speed of a Command-Line Interface (CLI), but with the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), when managing hotel guests. Think of it as muscle memory meets modern User Interface (UI) – if you can type, you can fly.

### **Target user**
___
**GuestNote** is designed for hotel concierges who manage a high volume of guest information and value the speed and control of a CLI-based interface.
It provides a streamlined alternative to bulky spreadsheets or slow point-and-click systems, making it ideal for fast typists and experienced front desk staff.

### **Value Proposition**
___
Designed with the fast-paced world of hotel operations in mind, **GuestNote** helps you:
- Quickly check in guests and assign rooms with just a few keystrokes
- View and manage essential guest information at a glance, all in one place
- Track and organise guest requests using simple, structured commands
- Reduce costly mistakes through built-in data validation
- Keep track of all guest requests in one place, so nothing gets missed or forgotten

With **GuestNote**, you can stay on top of guest needs, streamline daily concierge tasks, and ensure that no request falls through the cracks. Tailored to your team’s workflow, **GuestNote** simplifies routine processes so you can focus on delivering a smooth and memorable experience for every guest. Spend less time figuring things out and more time focusing on your guests. Provide your guests with a tailored experience, a home away from home.
