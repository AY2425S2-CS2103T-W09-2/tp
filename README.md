## **Overview**
___
This is **GuestNote**. <br>
GuestNote is a **desktop application for managing hotel guests**, optimized for fast typists. It allows hotel concierges to efficiently handle guest information, track requests, manage check-ins and check-outs using a **command-line interface (CLI)**.

### **Target user**
___
This product is for a **hotel concierge** to manage guests’ information who prefer a CLI over a graphical user interface (GUI) for fast access and easy view of the many guests to keep track of.

### **Value Proposition**
___
Our product will store guests’ information, allowing the concierge to:
1. Log requests and preferences in real-time.
2. Retrieve relevant guest list and past data. 
To provide guests with a tailored experience, a home away from home. 

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [GuestNote Product Website](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/tp/).
